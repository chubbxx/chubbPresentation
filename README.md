# chubbPresentation

`chubbPresentation` is a Python-based Telegram bot that utilizes OpenAI to assist in generating real-time responses and follow-up questions during presentations. This bot helps users in the process of preparing for a presentation by answering questions asked via Telegram and providing follow-up questions that can arise in a thesis defense session. The bot processes the questions and answers through OpenAI’s GPT-4 model and displays them on a Tkinter GUI on the presenter's laptop.

## Features
- **Telegram Bot**: Receives user questions and answers them in real-time via Telegram.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to process questions, stream answers, and provide follow-up questions.
- **Follow-Up Questions**: Automatically generates common follow-up questions that may be asked during a thesis presentation.
- **Tkinter GUI**: Outputs the answers and follow-up questions in a dark-themed, scrollable text window on the presenter’s laptop.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Provides answers while the presentation is ongoing, assisting with live Q&A.

## Prerequisites
1. **Python Version**  
   Python 3.7 or higher is required.
   
2. **API Keys**  
   - **OpenAI API Key**: A valid OpenAI API key is required.  
   - **Telegram Bot Token**: A Telegram bot token is needed to create and run the Telegram bot.
  
3. **Python Libraries**  
   Ensure the following libraries are installed:
   - `openai`
   - `python-telegram-bot`
   - `tkinter`
   - `requests`
   
   You can install the required dependencies using:

   ```bash
   pip install openai python-telegram-bot

## Steps to Create an Assistant in OpenAI and Obtain the Assistant ID

1. **Sign up for OpenAI**
If you don’t have an OpenAI account, create one at OpenAI's official website.

2. **Create a New Assistant**
After logging in to OpenAI, go to the Assistant API. Click on "Create New Assistant" and follow the instructions to set up your assistant. This may involve selecting the model (e.g., GPT-4 or GPT-3) and configuring its behavior for use in presentations. Save the Assistant ID once it's generated. This ID will be needed to interact with the assistant from the script.

3. **Upload Your PDF to Assistant**
The bot will assist you in a presentation by answering questions from a PDF document.

## How the Script Works
Telegram Interaction
The bot listens to incoming messages from users on Telegram and replies with answers generated by OpenAI’s assistant.
It automatically generates follow-up questions that can be useful for the thesis defense.
OpenAI Assistant Interaction
When the user asks a question, the message is sent to OpenAI’s assistant.
The bot streams responses to the GUI as they are generated.
The assistant’s responses are based on the uploaded PDF content (if relevant), making the answers contextually aware and appropriate for the presentation.
Tkinter GUI
The answers and follow-up questions appear in a dark-themed Tkinter window on the presenter's laptop.
This GUI is continuously updated with new messages until the session is complete.
